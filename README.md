# Solving_models_with_numerical_methods
Solving models with numerical methods (economics).
Introductory coding of numerical methods aimed at undergraduate / MSc students. There are several examples from economics and finance, and the codes are also provided.
The examples are:
1. Solow model transitional dynamics
2. Life-cycle model (log utility, T periods)
3. Two-period stochastic model - optimal stock choice
4. Two-period stochastic model - optimal portfolio of stocks and bonds
